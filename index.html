		<div><h3><a href="https://github.com/diegsmoran/vocabQuiz">JavaScript Quiz</h3></a> 
		<p>For this project, I wanted to make a vanilla JavaScript quiz that would rearrange questions at every attempt.
			The quiz includes multiple choice and true / false questions. I also wanted to showcase some quirky animations
			 and practice triggering them, based on certain events. This quiz is reponsive (mobile-friendly) as well.

		<div><h3><a href="https://github.com/diegsmoran/astra"> React Weather App</h3></a>
			<p>For this project, I made a simple responsive weather app. It obtains weather conditions from all across the world. It fetches data from OpenWeatherMapâ€™s API and updates the weather based on user input.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div><h3><a href="https://github.com/diegsmoran/beerApp"> Tall Tales App</h3></a>
			<p> For this project, I created an app that utilizes the Punk API that can search through Brewdog's expansive catalogue of beers. It allows you to filter their beer from the amount of alcohol percentage it contains,
				making it convenient for users to discover beer with their taste in mind.

				<p> The tasks I was initially given in regards to the website was to create wireframes for the category section, banners and touching up product photos. Eventually, the needs for the website
					grew when I was tasked to lead on the deployment of the website and making sure it went as smoothly as possible. I stayed in contact with the developer and offered suggestions
					such as certain media quieries that would make our website look cleaner and more responsive on mobile.
